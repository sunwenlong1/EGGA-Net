## Usage
We provide `code`, `data_split` and `models` for LA and ACDC dataset.

Data could be got at [LA](https://github.com/yulequan/UA-MT/tree/master/data) and [ACDC](https://github.com/HiLab-git/SSL4MIS/tree/master/data/ACDC).

To train a model,
```
python ./code/LA_EGGA_train.py  #for LA training
python ./code/ACDC_EGGA_train.py  #for ACDC training
``` 

We provide all the EGGA model parameters trained on ACDC and LA. 链接: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KVje2cl7Acth33juYCg7Sw?pwd=vqw5 提取码: vqw5


To test a model,
```
python ./code/test_LA.py  #for LA testing
python ./code/test_ACDC.py  #for ACDC testing
```
